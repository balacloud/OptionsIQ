## Session Protocol

### Startup Checklist (read IN THIS ORDER before any code or plan)
1. `CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md` ← this file — current state, known issues, next priorities
2. `docs/stable/GOLDEN_RULES.md` — constraints and process rules
3. `docs/stable/ROADMAP.md` — phase status, done vs pending
4. `docs/status/PROJECT_STATUS_DAY12_SHORT.md` — latest day status (update filename each day)
5. `docs/versioned/KNOWN_ISSUES_DAY12.md` — open bugs and severity (update filename each day)
6. `docs/stable/API_CONTRACTS.md` — only if touching API endpoints

After reading, state: current version, current day's top priority, any blockers. Then ask: "What would you like to focus on today?"

Behavioral rules (do not skip):
- Do NOT ask user to re-explain the project
- Do NOT ask for files unless you need to modify them
- Do NOT jump to fixing — understand the problem first

### Close Checklist (end of every session — Golden Rule 9)

**Step 1 — Ask before updating:**
- "Did any bugs get fixed or found this session?" → drives KNOWN_ISSUES update
- "Did any APIs change?" → drives API_CONTRACTS update
- "Did we learn a new rule or process lesson?" → drives GOLDEN_RULES update

**Step 2 — Update all docs (Claude does this, no manual user action needed):**
- [ ] `CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md` — Last Updated, Current State table, Session Log, Next Session Priorities
- [ ] `docs/versioned/KNOWN_ISSUES_DAY{N}.md` — create new file, mark resolved, add new
- [ ] `docs/stable/ROADMAP.md` — tick completed items, add new ones
- [ ] `docs/status/PROJECT_STATUS_DAY{N}_SHORT.md` — create new status snapshot
- [ ] `docs/stable/API_CONTRACTS.md` — if any endpoint added or changed
- [ ] `docs/stable/GOLDEN_RULES.md` — if new rule or process lesson learned
- [ ] `memory/MEMORY.md` — update phase, file statuses, priorities
- [ ] Git commit and push (skip push if no remote configured yet)

## What This System Does

OptionsIQ is a personal options analysis tool. It takes a stock ticker, pulls the live options chain from IBKR, runs gate checks, and recommends the top 3 strike/expiry combinations for the chosen direction. It records paper trades with live mark-to-market.

It is NOT a broker. It sends zero orders to IBKR. Analysis only.

---

## Relationship to STA

- **STA** (Swing Trade Analyzer) runs at `localhost:5001` — separate repo, feature-frozen
- **OptionsIQ** calls STA API endpoints to import swing fields (stop, target, ADX, pattern, etc.)
- If STA is offline, OptionsIQ falls back to Manual mode — user enters fields directly
- Zero code shared between the two projects — integration is HTTP only

### Backend Files (current state)
```
backend/
  app.py              ~600 lines — HARDENED (Day 12): logger defined, ACCOUNT_SIZE guard,
                                   outer try-except on analyze, bare excepts named+logged.
                                   Still needs analyze_service.py split (Day 13 P2).
  constants.py        DONE (Day 12) — 19 new thresholds: IV abs fallback, DTE signal quality,
                                      SPY regime per direction, STRIKE_SAFETY_RATIO, SELL_CALL_OTM_PASS_PCT
  bs_calculator.py    DONE — Black-Scholes greeks + price (scipy)
  ib_worker.py        DONE — single thread, submit() queue, expires_at, heartbeat (30s idle)
  yfinance_provider.py DONE — emergency fallback (no greeks — computed via BS)
  data_service.py     DONE (Day 12) — provider cascade + SQLite WAL + timeout + CB + Alpaca tier
  ibkr_provider.py    DONE (Day 12) — try-finally cancelMktData (no zombie subs).
                                     OI via reqMktData CONFIRMED unavailable (platform limitation).
                                     direction-aware strike sort (sell_call asc, sell_put desc)
  alpaca_provider.py  DONE (Day 10) — REST fallback, greeks ✅, NO OI/volume (model limitation)
                                     alpaca-py SDK, OCC parsing, direction-aware DTE/strike windows
                                     Tier 4 in cascade (between stale cache and yfinance)
  mock_provider.py    PARTIAL — still partially hardcoded (low priority)
  gate_engine.py      DONE (Day 12) — Rule 3 fixed: imports from constants.py (60+ literals replaced).
                                     Liquidity gate: OI=0+Vol>0 → WARN not BLOCK.
                                     Still math-frozen — coerce None→0.0 before gate_payload.
  strategy_ranker.py  UPDATED (Day 12) — sell_put naked put warning added to all 3 strategies.
                                        _rank_sell_call → bear_call_spread (delta 0.30/0.15) ✓
                                        _rank_buy_put   → ITM put + bear put spread + ATM put ✓
                                        _rank_track_b   → naked sell_put + naked warning
  pnl_calculator.py   FIXED (Day 9) — None guard, handlers for itm_put/atm_put/bear_call_spread/sell_call
                                       spread handler direction-aware via right field
  iv_store.py         FROZEN — math correct

  # TO CREATE:
  marketdata_provider.py  Day 13 — MarketData.app REST provider ($12/mo — pending)
  analyze_service.py      Day 13 P2 — extract _merge_swing, _extract_iv_data, _behavioral_checks
```

## Architecture

**Backend:** Flask on port 5051
**Frontend:** React on port 3050
**IB Gateway:** 127.0.0.1:4001 (live account U11574928)
**Database:** SQLite at `backend/data/` (chain_cache.db + iv_store.db)

### Data Provider Hierarchy (live-first)
```
[1] IBKR Live (reqMktData snapshot=False)  ← DEFAULT (greeks confirmed Day 9)
[2] IBKR Cache (SQLite, TTL 2 min)         ← "Using cached chain" banner
[2.5] MarketData.app (PLANNED, $12/mo)    ← greeks+IV+OI+volume, 15-min delayed
[3] Alpaca indicative (DONE, free)         ← greeks+IV but NO OI/volume
[4] yfinance (emergency fallback)          ← NO real greeks (BS computed from HV)
[5] Mock (dev/CI testing ONLY)             ← NEVER for paper trades
```

### IBWorker Thread Model
```
Flask thread → IBWorker.submit(fn, timeout=24s) → queue.Queue → "ib-worker" thread
                ↓ (if timeout expires on Flask side)         ↓
          TimeoutError raised                          _Request.expires_at checked
          (request already in queue)                   → expired = discard, log warning
                                                       → fresh = execute normally

Idle > 30s: worker sends reqCurrentTime() → _last_heartbeat updated
is_connected(): checks ib.isConnected() flag AND _last_heartbeat < 75s ago
```
**Critical:** All IBKRProvider calls MUST go through IBWorker.submit(). Never call
ibkr_provider methods directly from Flask routes or helpers.

### Direction-Aware Chain Fetch
```
buy_call  → DTE 45-90 (buyer sweet spot) + strikes 8-20% ITM below underlying
buy_put   → DTE 45-90 (buyer sweet spot) + strikes 8-20% ITM above underlying
sell_call → DTE 21-45 (seller sweet spot) + strikes ATM ±6%
sell_put  → DTE 21-45 (seller sweet spot) + strikes ATM ±6%
```
Structure cache (4h in-memory, invalidates if underlying drifts >15%) avoids repeated reqSecDefOptParams.
When <3 contracts qualify, automatic retry with ±15% broad window across 3 expiries.

### Market Hours Behavior (KI-024 resolved Day 6)
```
MARKET OPEN (9:30am–4:00pm ET, Mon–Fri):
  reqMktData(snapshot=False) → tickOptionComputation fires → live modelGreeks
  data_source = "ibkr_live", greeks_pct ~80-100% (pending verification Day 8)

MARKET CLOSED (evenings, weekends, pre-market):
  IBKRProvider._market_is_open() → False → skip reqTickers
  Calls _get_hv_estimate(ticker) via yfinance → 20-day HV as IV proxy
  Computes BS greeks for all qualified contracts
  data_source = "ibkr_closed" (new tier in data_service)
  Frontend: amber banner "Market closed — using estimated greeks"
  Liquidity gate still FAILs (OI=0 expected), but theta/delta/vega are real
```

### STA Field Mapping (verified Day 5)
```
STA /api/sr/{ticker}: suggestedEntry → entry_pullback, suggestedStop → stop_loss,
                      suggestedTarget → target1, riskReward → risk_reward,
                      meta.adx.adx → adx, support[-1] → s1_support
STA /api/stock/{ticker}: currentPrice → last_close + entry_momentum
STA /api/patterns/{ticker}: patterns.vcp.confidence → vcp_confidence,
                             patterns.vcp.pivot_price → vcp_pivot
STA /api/earnings/{ticker}: days_until → earnings_days_away (NOT days_away)
STA /api/context/SPY: cycles.cards[FOMC].raw_value → fomc_days_away
yfinance SPY: computed in backend → spy_above_200sma, spy_5day_return
```

## Four Directions

| Direction | Market View | Gate Track | Strike Preference |
|-----------|------------|------------|-------------------|
| buy_call | Extremely Bullish | Track A | ITM delta ~0.68 |
| sell_call | Neutral to Bearish | Track A | Far OTM / ATM |
| buy_put | Extremely Bearish | Track B | ITM delta ~-0.68 |
| sell_put | Neutral to Bullish | Track B | Far OTM below support |

**DTE window:** 14 to 120 days (all directions)
**Sweet spot buyers:** 45-90 DTE
**Sweet spot sellers:** 21-45 DTE (enforced by gate logic)

**Direction locking:** BUY signal → locks sell_call + buy_put. SELL signal → locks buy_call + sell_put.

## Known Issues

Full list: `docs/versioned/KNOWN_ISSUES_DAY12.md`

Open (HIGH):
1. **KI-044: API_CONTRACTS.md stale** — verdict, gates, strategies, behavioral_checks all differ from code

Open (MEDIUM):
2. **analyze_service.py missing** — app.py still ~600 lines (KI-001/KI-023)
3. **Synthetic swing defaults silent** (KI-022/KI-005)
4. **NVDA buy_put sparse** — only 3 contracts qualify (KI-025)

Open (LOW):
5. **Alpaca OI/volume missing** (KI-038)
6. OHLCV temporal gap validation (KI-034)
7. fomc_days_away defaults to 30 (KI-008)
8. API URL hardcoded (KI-013)

Resolved (Day 12):
- KI-040 logger crash, KI-041 QualityBanner mismatch, KI-042 SQLite WAL, KI-043 subscription leak
- KI-045 outer try-except, KI-046 bare excepts, KI-047 gate_engine constants, KI-048 missing banners
- KI-035 OI: CONFIRMED platform limitation — graceful degradation (WARN not BLOCK) is permanent fix
- sell_put naked warning, ACCOUNT_SIZE startup guard

| Day 4 | Mar 7, 2026 | KI-016 queue poisoning (expires_at). KI-017 RequestTimeout=15. KI-018 legacy CB removed (821→527). KI-020 strategy_ranker right=None. Ticker override + STA offline fixed. MEOH confirmed live. |
| Day 5 | Mar 10, 2026 | KI-019 heartbeat done. STA field mapping fixed (suggestedEntry/Stop/Target). spy_above_200sma from yfinance. Direction lock SELL. Struct cache drift invalidation (15%). SMART_MAX_EXPIRIES 1→2, SMART_MAX_STRIKES 4→6, broad retry <3 contracts. start.sh .env fix. CTRA+NVDA tested. Market-closed behavior diagnosed (KI-024 new). |
| Day 6 | Mar 10, 2026 | KI-024 market hours detection. ibkr_provider: _market_is_open() (ET TZ), _get_hv_estimate() (20-day HV). BS greeks when closed. ibkr_closed tier in data_service. Frontend amber banner + "IB Closed" header. Fixed logger import + broad retry variable scope bug. |
| Day 7 | Mar 10, 2026 | Strategy ranker: explicit builders for sell_call (bear call spread) + buy_put (long put + bear put spread) — KI-021 fixed. Root cause of modelGreeks=None found: reqTickers() doesn't fire tickOptionComputation. Replaced with reqMktData(snapshot=False) throughout. Phase 4d extended wait (sleep 3+5). Phase 4e BS fallback if usopt still silent. Confirmed OPRA subscription adequate (no new subscription needed). Stale AMD chain cache cleared (strike mismatch at ~182 vs live ~205). |
| Day 8 | Mar 11, 2026 | Process session — no code changes. Created CLAUDE.md (session pointer). Added startup + close checklists to CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md. Enforced ordered priming: CLAUDE_CONTEXT → GOLDEN_RULES → ROADMAP → PROJECT_STATUS → KNOWN_ISSUES → API_CONTRACTS. |
| Day 9 | Mar 11, 2026 | KI-026 live greeks CONFIRMED (100% greeks_pct, ibkr_live, Phase 4e never fired). KI-030 AMD hv_20 corruption fixed (deleted 20 bad ohlcv rows). KI-031 pnl_calculator None crash fixed + 4 strategy type handlers added. KI-033 sell_call bear_call_spread fixed: direction-aware sort + SMART_MAX_STRIKES 6→12 + MAX_CONTRACTS 12→26. OI field fix: optOpenInterest. Alpaca researched: great REST fallback, needs alpaca_provider.py + API secret. |
| Day 10 | Mar 12, 2026 | KI-035 OI fix applied (genericTickList="101"). alpaca_provider.py CREATED + wired into DataService+app.py. .env syntax fix. Alpaca live-tested: greeks ✅, OI/volume ❌ (model limitation). MarketData.app live-tested: current greeks ✅, historical IV=None (unknown if trial/platform). Perplexity research: 9 providers compared, none under $30/mo has historical IV. Research doc created (docs/Research/). Golden Rule 19 added. |
| Day 11 | Mar 13, 2026 | KI-037 CONFIRMED (MarketData.app no historical IV — platform limitation). System coherence audit: 47 findings. Behavioral audit: 17 claims, 8 verified, 3 misleading, 5 false. Key findings: liquidity gate permanently broken (OI=0), gate_engine 60+ hardcoded thresholds (Rule 3 violated), 2 missing quality banners, sell_put naked with no warning, DTE buyer sweet spot not enforced, ACCOUNT_SIZE silently defaults. Sector rotation ETF module researched. |
| Day 12 | Mar 17, 2026 | All Phase A+D critical/high audit fixes shipped during market hours. KI-035 OI confirmed platform limitation — graceful degradation added (WARN not BLOCK). gate_engine Rule 3 fixed (60+ literals → constants.py). SQLite WAL. reqMktData try-finally. Startup guard for ACCOUNT_SIZE. sell_put naked warning. QualityBanner fixed. alpaca+ibkr_stale banners added. System now usable for live analysis. |

## Next Session Priorities (Day 13)

### P0 — Phase B: API_CONTRACTS.md sync (KI-044)
Update spec to match actual code. Mismatches in: verdict structure, gate field names, strategy fields,
behavioral_checks format, direction_locked. Frontend already matches code — spec is the stale one.

### P1 — Sector Rotation Backend
- `sector_scan_service.py` — STA consumer + quadrant→direction mapping + IV overlay (~150 lines)
- `GET /api/sectors/scan` (L1) + `GET /api/sectors/analyze/{ticker}` (L2)
- L3 reuses `POST /api/options/analyze` — zero new code
- See: `docs/Research/Sector_Rotation_ETF_Module_Day11.md`

### P2 — analyze_service.py extraction
Extract `_merge_swing`, `_extract_iv_data`, `_behavioral_checks` from app.py.
Goal: app.py ≤ 150 lines (Rule 4). Currently ~600 lines.

### P3 — bull_put_spread for sell_put
strategy_ranker.py `_rank_track_b`: currently naked sell_put only.
Add spread builder (parallel to existing bear_call_spread logic for sell_call).

### Deferred (low priority)
- Phase C: Provider consistency (None vs 0, bs_greeks flag)
- Phase E: Performance (deepcopy overhead, struct_cache LRU)
- Phase F: Documentation sync
- DTE buyer sweet spot: enforce 45-90 or accept signal-based? (Claim 3)
- marketdata_provider.py ($12/mo — only if IBKR OI permanently unavailable)

### Reference
- `docs/Research/Behavioral_Audit_Day11.md` — behavioral audit (17 claims)
- `docs/Research/System_Coherence_Audit_Day11.md` — coherence audit (47 items)
- `docs/Research/Sector_Rotation_ETF_Module_Day11.md` — ETF module research
- `docs/versioned/KNOWN_ISSUES_DAY12.md` — current issue list
- `docs/status/PROJECT_STATUS_DAY12_SHORT.md` — Day 12 summary
